## Servings: 6 normal people, 4 college students, or 1 Joe Choi

## Time to prepare: 20 mins prep, 30 mins cooking

## Ingredients:
- 6 chicken thighs, bone in or out, with or without skin* (Can also substitute Seitan or Tempeh as vegan protein)
  OR 1 pound firm tofu
- Salt and pepper, to season
- teaspoons garlic powder, to season
- cloves garlic, crushed
- 1/3 cup honey
- 1/4 cup water (or chicken/vegetable broth)
- 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar, or any white vinegar)
- 3 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 cups uncooked rice
- 1/2 cup peas
- 1/2 cup chopped carrots
- 2 eggs (optional)
## Equipment needed:
<br>Mixing bowl
<br>Pan or skillet x2
<br>Pot
## Steps for preparation:
Season chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder; set aside.
<br>Heat a pan or skillet over medium high heat; sear chicken thigh fillets or breast fillets (or tofu) on both sides until golden and cooked through.
<br>FOR BONE IN THIGHS:
<br>Reduce heat after searing on both sides, cover skillet with a lid and continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, while turning every 5 minutes until done. Alternatively, see notes for oven method.
<br>Drain most of the excess oil from the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons of pan juiced for added flavour.
<br>FOR SAUCE:
<br>When chicken or tofu is done and cooked through, arrange chicken or tofu skin-side up in the pan (if cooking with skin); add the garlic between the chicken and fry until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the honey, water, vinegar and soy sauce. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook until the sauce reduces down and thicken slightly (about 3-4 minutes).
<br>Garnish with parsley and serve over vegetables, rice, pasta or with a salad.
<br>Steps for fried rice
<br>Place uncooked rice into a pot (adding oil at the bottom will help prevent it from sticking when it cookes), and add 4 cups of water
<br>Place on stove, and cook on high until water starts boiling, then reduce heat to low and let cook for 20-25 min. (until water is gone)
<br>Mix peas, carrots, and eggs into a pan on medium-high heat; and cook until eggs are fully cooked/scrambled
<br>Add rice to the pan and cook on high heat; add soy sauce to taste at the very end
### Notes:
*For chicken breasts: use 3 breasts, sliced horizontally in half. Sear breast fillets on each side until golden and cooked through (about 6 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of your fillets). Continue directions from the sauce, onwards.**For oven baked, bone-in thighs: Preheat oven at 400°F or 200°C. Sear chicken in an oven proof skillet or pan, skin side down first for 3 minutes. Flip and sear for a further 3 minutes until browned each side. Then bake in the oven for a further 20-25 minutes, until completely cooked through and no longer pink inside. Continue directions from the sauce, onwards.
