# Honey Garlic Chicken (or Tofu) Recipe

## Servings: 6 people

## Time to prepare: 30 mins total

## Ingredients:
  6 chicken thighs, bone in or out, with or without skin*
  OR 1 pound firm tofu
  <br>Salt and pepper, to season
<br>2 teaspoons garlic powder, to season
<br>6 cloves garlic, crushed
<br>1/3 cup honey
<br>1/4 cup water (or chicken broth)
<br>2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar, or any white vinegar)
<br>1 tablespoon soy sauce

## Equipment needed:
<br>Mixing bowl
<br>Pan or skillet

## Steps for preparation:
Season chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder; set aside.
<br>Heat a pan or skillet over medium high heat; sear chicken thigh fillets or breast fillets (or tofu) on both sides until golden and cooked through.
<br>FOR BONE IN THIGHS:
<br>Reduce heat after searing on both sides, cover skillet with a lid and continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, while turning every 5 minutes until done. Alternatively, see notes for oven method.
<br>Drain most of the excess oil from the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons of pan juiced for added flavour.
<br>FOR SAUCE:
<br>When chicken or tofu is done and cooked through, arrange chicken or tofu skin-side up in the pan (if cooking with skin); add the garlic between the chicken and fry until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the honey, water, vinegar and soy sauce. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook until the sauce reduces down and thicken slightly (about 3-4 minutes).
<br>Garnish with parsley and serve over vegetables, rice, pasta or with a salad.

### Notes:
*For chicken breasts: use 3 breasts, sliced horizontally in half. Sear breast fillets on each side until golden and cooked through (about 6 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of your fillets). Continue directions from the sauce, onwards.**For oven baked, bone-in thighs: Preheat oven at 400°F or 200°C. Sear chicken in an oven proof skillet or pan, skin side down first for 3 minutes. Flip and sear for a further 3 minutes until browned each side. Then bake in the oven for a further 20-25 minutes, until completely cooked through and no longer pink inside. Continue directions from the sauce, onwards.
