# Korean Spicy Pork

## Servings: 2-4

## Time to prepare: (1-8 hr. prep) 30 min. cook time

## Ingredients:
2 lbs. pork
1/3 cup gochujang sauce
 1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
 2 tablespoons sesame oil
 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
 2 tablespoons light brown sugar, packed
 2 teaspoons ground ginger
 4 to 5 cloves garlic, finely minced or pressed
 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into bite sized pieces
 2 tablespoons olive oil
 1 teaspoon cornstarch
 1 scant teaspoon cold water
 green onions, diced into thin rounds for garnishing
 sesame seeds, for garnishing



## Equipment needed:
Large bowl
Measuring cups
Measuring spoons
Skillet



## Steps for preparation:

1) To a large bowl, add the gochujang sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, brown sugar, ginger, garlic, and stir to combine.
2) Add the pork, cover, and place in the fridge to marinate for at least 1 hour, or up to 8 hours.
3) To a large skillet, add the olive oil, and using a slotted spoon add the chicken (discard leftover marinade), and cook over medium-high heat for about 5 to 7 minutes, or until pork is cooked through; flip intermittently to ensure even cooking.
4) While the pork cooks, to a small bowl add the cornstarch, water, and stir to combine until dissolved.
After the pork has cooked through, add the cornstarch slurry to the side of the pan (don’t dump it over the chicken), turn the heat to medium-low, and gently stir the slurry into into the pan sauce. Keep stirring for about 1 to 2 minutes, or until sauce has thickened up to desired level. Spoon the thickened sauce over the pork or just flip them around in the sauce to coat them evenly. Note – the cornstarch addition is not absolutely necessary but it will help make the sauce thicker and with more body rather as opposed to runny and find the extra 1 to 2 minutes worth it.

Remove pan from the heat, add the green onions, sesame seeds, and serve immediately. Pork is best warm and fresh but will keep for up to 5 days in the fridge.


### Notes:

You can do this with any other meat (e.g., chicken, beef)
