## Optional: Cold Brew Coffee

## Serves 4 people

## Prep Time: 12 hours and 15 minutes

## Ingredients: 
## 1 cup (113 grams) whole coffee beans
## 4 cups (907 grams) water

## Coffee or spice grinder
## 1 1/2 quart (or larger) glass, ceramic, or plastic container (I use a 2-quart canning jar)
## Small strainer
## Cheesecloth or cotton flour sack cloth (I like these)
## Bottle or jar, for storing your cold-brew


## 1. Coarsely grind the coffee: Grind the coffee beans on the coarsest setting on your grinder, or in short 1-second pulses in a spice grinder. 
## 2. Combine the coffee and the water: Transfer the coffee grounds to the container you're using to make the cold brew. Pour the water over top. Stir gently with a long-handled spoon to make sure the grounds are thoroughly saturated with water.
## 3. Steep overnight: Cover the jar with a lid or a small plate to protect it from dust and bugs. Let the coffee steep for about 12 hours. The coffee can be left on the counter or refrigerated; steeping time is the same.
## 4. Strain the coffee: Line a small strainer with cheesecloth or flour sack cloth and place over a large measuring cup or bowl. Pour the coffee through the strainer.
## 5. Store or Serve the coffee: Dilute the coffee with as much water or milk as you prefer. Serve over ice or warm for a few minutes in the microwave.
